// BINARY SEARCH

/*
 * Binary search is a search algorithm used to find the position of a target value within a SORTED ARRAY.
 * 		Implementation behind binary search:
 * 			>> Divide the search space into two halves by finding the middle index “mid”. 
			>> Compare the middle element of the search space with the key. 
			>> If the key is found at middle element, the process is terminated.
			>> If the key is not found at middle element, choose which half will be used as the next search space.
				>> If the key is smaller than the middle element, then the left side is used for next search.
				>> If the key is larger than the middle element, then the right side is used for next search.
			>> This process is continued until the key is found or the total search space is exhausted.
